                        I got these gifted from an aunt around 2-3 years ago and it&apos;s pretty good. It&apos;s more geared toward people who work in production for music and audio engineering, but it&apos;s not bad for general listening.
                        I will say if you are a bass head, these are NOT it. Because it&apos;s a studio headphone, the sound is very neutral in order to get the most accurate sound. If you&apos;re into that type of this, then these heaphones are a solid pick üëç.
